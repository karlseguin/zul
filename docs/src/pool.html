<p>A thread-safe object pool which will dynamically grow when empty and revert to the configured size.</p>

<h2 id=example><a href=#example aria-hidden=true>Example</a></h2>

<h2><code>fn Growing(comptime T: type, comptime C: type) Growing(T, C)</code></h2>
<p>The <code>Growing</code> pool is a generic function that takes two parameters. <code>T</code> is the type of object being pool. <code>C</code> is the type of data to pass into <code>T.init</code>. In many cases, <code>C</code> will be <code>void</code>, in which case <code>T.init</code> will not receive the value:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
var pool = try zul.pool.Growing(Expensive, void).init(allocator, {}, .{.count = 100});
defer pool.deinit();

...

const Expensive = struct {
	// Because the context was defined as `void`, the `init` function does not
	// take a 2nd paremeter.
	pub fn init(allocator: Allocator) !Expensive {
		return .{
			// ...
		};
	}

	// ...
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>T</code> must have an <code>init(allocator: Allocator, ctx: C) !T</code> function. It must also have the following two methods: <code>deinit(self: *T) void</code> and <code>reset(self: *T) void</code>. Because the pool will dynamically create <code>T</code> when empty, <code>deinit</code> will be called when items are released back into a full pool (as well as when <code>pool.deinit</code> is called). <code>reset</code> is called whenever an item is released back into the pool.</p>
